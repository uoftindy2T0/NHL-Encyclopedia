    "currentSR": "He has always had an excellent wrist shot, and the rest of his game continues to develop as he enters his 30s. Also has an effective backhander that is a legitimate scoring weapon. Has filled out over the years and is harder to knock off the puck. Has become a more effective playmaker, which makes his shot even more effective. Has also developed into a useful penalty killer.",
    "juniorSR": "Nelson is a powerful kid that skates well and is very creative with the puck. He has great hands and with his speed, he can carry the puck and see the entire ice. The kid has a huge upside. He is set to attend North Dakota next season where he will be expected to improve his game. Comes from a hockey family. He hasn't been tested enough because of playing high school hockey. The level of competition allowed him to put up unbelievable numbers and didn't test him enough. He is very rough around the edges and will have to improve the little things that are taken for granted in the high school game.",
